# ðŸ“˜ Cloud Computing Research  (Extra Notes)

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Introduction to Cloud Computing  
Cloud computing is a technology that enables users to **access and store data, run applications, and utilize computing power** over the internet, rather than relying on local hardware. It improves efficiency, scalability, and flexibility in IT operations.  

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Cloud Service Models  
Cloud services are classified into different models based on their functionalities:  
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** â€“ Provides virtualized computing resources like servers and storage.  
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** â€“ Offers a platform for application development, including runtime environments and tools.  
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)** â€“ Delivers fully functional applications to end users via the cloud.  
- *(Optional: FaaS â€“ Function as a Service, BaaS â€“ Backend as a Service)*  

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Cloud Deployment Models  
Different deployment approaches define how cloud computing is utilized:  
- **Public Cloud** â€“ Services are available to anyone over the internet (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud).  
- **Private Cloud** â€“ Dedicated cloud resources for a specific organization, ensuring enhanced security.  
- **Hybrid Cloud** â€“ A combination of public and private clouds for flexible operations.  
- **Community Cloud** â€“ Shared cloud infrastructure among multiple organizations with similar needs.
